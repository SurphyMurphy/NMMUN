              <h2>Topic 1: Improving to bring economic security and stability in Sri Lanka</h2>
              <p>
                Sri Lanka is facing the worst economic crisis in decades since its independence in 1948 and critics say its roots emerge from economic mismanagement by 
                successive governments that created and sustained a twin deficit- budget shortfall and a current account deficit followed by a deep cut in taxes(2019) 
                and the Covid-19 lockdown which shut down Sri Lanka's tourism and reduced its foreign exchange reserves by 70%, it is unable to import essential commodities 
                or fuel due to this. The government policy of banning various chemical plants hit the farming sector which led to a drop in food and cash crops. Currently, 
                the government is left with only 2.31 billion dollars but faces debt repayment of $ 4 billion as of 2022. Sri Lanka is yet to pay its ISB(International 
                sovereignty bond) which is $12.5 billion. Due to this economic crisis fuelled by the Russia and Ukraine war, People are paying for the economic crisis, 
                civilians are facing constant power cuts, no access to health care and education, and are requested to work from home to conserve resources. Members of 
                the IMF must come together to find possible solutions to revise the Sri Lankan economy and protect it from debt collectors while bringing peace and stability 
                to the region.

              <h2>Topic 2: Tackling the silent European economic crises</h2>
              <p>
                Europe is facing an economic crisis after the Russia-Ukraine war, its inflation is soaring towards two digits and has dwindled its purchasing power and 
                using its spare cash to buy fuel, natural gas, and food, it's been recorded that retail sales have plummeted by 4%. Europe's decision to impose economic 
                and diplomatic sanctions on Russia for its unjustified attack on Ukraine might lead to a recession in Europe and reports suggest that 5 European countries 
                are already at a risk. Russia is the 2nd largest exporter of oil and natural gas and isn't supplying to the Europe region anymore causing a shortage in 
                energy supplies in the coming winters. Countries must build policy measures to prevent Europe from falling into an official recession and control the 
                inflation arising in the Eurozone.

                    Meet Aditya Sundaram, the chairperson of the International Monetary Fund for NMMUN 2022!
                    Aditya is a hard-working and humorous person. He occupies himself by playing football, basketball, running, and creating art! He is the MJD sports U19 captain, has participated in the Goan Football Association league held in 21-22, won the most promising goalkeeper award and was a notable participant in the Bahrain Expo 2019 art exhibition.
                    Aditya’s MUN journey has been a path of immense self-growth, teaching him resilience and instilling an ardent passion for debate and public speaking. As the chairperson of IMF, he wishes to fulfil his appetite for chairing an offline MUN and developing multifaceted qualities. He hopes that delegates are participative, approachable and active!

                    Meet Nandana Menon, the chairperson of the International Monetary Fund for NMMUN ’22!
                    Nandana is an artistic person, with several honors from dance, music and other co-scholastic areas, to prove it. Her abilities to empathize and to get things done are some admirable qualities that help her multitask efficiently.
                    “It was a rollercoaster of emotions, but at the end, I ventured out of my comfort zone, and that's still something I'm proud of”, she says, when asked about her first MUN experience.  
                    During this conference, she hopes to inspire at least one delegate to take up MUNs like her past chairs have always done. She wants the delegates to know, “Don't be afraid to grab any chance you get to speak. Everyone, including us chairs, are learning as we go, so it's okay to make mistakes!”

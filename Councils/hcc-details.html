              <h2>Topic 1: Falklands War 1982</h2>
              <p>
                The fight for Sovereignty over the Falkland islands by the British and the Argentine forces started in 1765. After 149 years of political disputes, in 1982 
                The Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri invaded the British-occupied Falkland Islands. Argentina claims that the islands are Argentine territory, and 
                the Argentine government thus characterized its military action as the reclamation of its territory. The British government regarded the action as an 
                invasion of a territory they had held since 1841. The goal of this committee is to objectively analyze both countries' claims to sovereignty and conclude 
                the best way to determine who has legitimate sovereignty of the islands.

              <h2>Topic 2: The Cold War Purge</h2>
              <p>
                Against the backdrop of the Cold War, The government of America issued a purge to solve the mass hysteria among the citizens. Americans can now commit crimes 
                for 12 hours without facing any repercussions. The government of America believes that this move will effectively ‘cleanse’ the country from possible communist 
                spies and keep their beloved motherland free from foreign influence. Other anti-communist countries like Uk and France have also agreed to use this purge as a 
                fast and effective way to get rid of most of their prisoners of war without being answerable to other countries. The goal of this committee is for countries to 
                debate whether America’s decision was just and if so, should it be implemented in other countries as well ….how they’ve done this without consulting the other 
                counties?

                    Meet Pradyuman Nair, the chairperson of the Historical Crisis Committee for NMMUN 2022!
                    Pradyuman describes himself as “apples and bananas”. He enjoys playing basketball, football, building Lego and scrolling through Instagram. “MUN is lyfe mun rulezz”, he says, as he recollects how MUN has helped him learn that it is good to be strong and weak, “we ball”. Alongside active participation in MUNs, winning him numerous awards, he scores goals.
                    Having taken part in several crisis committees, he seeks to use his background and learnings while chairing HCC. He wishes to kindle a sense of security and acceptance among beginners, and a sense of pride among experienced delegates. Offering his expert advice to delegates, he comments, “it’s grind szn”.

                    Meet Samira Abbey, the chairperson of the Historical Crisis Committee for NMMUN 2022!
                    Samira is a quick thinker and a great listener. They are adamant about women empowerment and the establishment of equality. She loves to read, make coffee and fangirl over Taylor Swift!
                    MUN has taught them to be creative with her approaches to solve problems, and carefully pick what to argue on. It has also taught them to structure her points formally. As the chair of HCC, she loves to help and guide delegates and offer constructive criticism.
                    Samira advices the delegates to think about their countries’ stance, while not overcomplicating solutions, as that could cause loopholes. They hope to ensure that delegates improve their debate skills while learning to handle criticism in different ways.

              <h2>Topic 1: Prevent and treat Non-Communicable diseases and mental health conditions </h2>
              <p>
                The non-communicable disease also commonly known as NCDs disproportionately affects people in low-income and middle-income countries. 
                These diseases consist of heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes which are the leading cause of death worldwide and are an 
                emerging global health threat. Deaths from NCDs now exceed all communicable disease deaths combined. NCDs kill 41 million people each year and are 
                responsible for 7 out of 10 deaths. The rapid change in social, economic, and lifestyle kills 15 million prematurely. The problem not only affects 
                people but becomes a financial burden on many governments which makes it a global economic burden for NCDs. It is predicted that in the next 20 years 
                NCDs alone would cost more than $30 trillion and an additional $16.1 trillion on mental health. Countries must come together to find an effective 
                solution for reducing the cost of health care and protecting the well-being of their citizens.

              <h2>Topic 2: Delivering health amid conflict</h2>
              <p>War and conflict cause a significant loss of human life and is a major cause of disability worldwide. War diverts essential and often scarce 
                resources from those who need it to invest in defense and buy ammunition. Conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, etc have forced people to flee 
                their homes to faraway asylums where healthcare accessibility and quality are reduced which has recently led to disease spikes such as tuberculosis, 
                Hepatitis B, covid-19. Bombings, shellings, and violent protest has led to the loss of many hospitals and pharmacies and has led to the displacement
                of 70 million people who have also lost access to food, water, and shelter and suffer acute malnutrition. An MSF hospital in Yemen's Saada province 
                was destroyed in October 2015, meaning that 200,000 people instantly lost access to vital medical care. During a war, people get hurt physically 
                but the war has a negative lasting effect on the mental well-being of civilians. People who live through war face psychologically challenging situations, 
                often being uprooted from their homes, facing food insecurity, and constant fear of death and injury. It is necessary for countries involved in conflicts
                and developed countries to come together to restructure the lost health care infrastructure and to provide essential supplies to the displaced people.

              <h2>Topic 1: Arms Control and Disarmament of small arms of Permanent members of UNSC</h2>
              <p>
                The proliferation and stockpiling of small arms and their distribution have continued to threaten world peace and security. The circulation of small 
                arms has resulted in forming terrorist groups preventing peace agreements from taking place and The accessibility of small arms in the hands of regular 
                civilians has resulted in mass school shootings, and hate crimes against religions. Currently, there are more than 650 million firearms in the hands of 
                civilians which is threatening peace-building measures. More than 1000 companies are producing small arms in over 30 countries and transporting them to 
                houses that are not guarded with enough security and making it easier for non-state actors to divert these arms from private suppliers. Circulation of 
                small arms has negative impacts on development, they damage fragile economies, deter foreign investments, divert economic resources, inhibit the fulfillment 
                of basic human needs, and facilitate human rights violations such as killing, maiming, sexual violence, torture, and forced recruitment of children by
                armed and criminal groups. The small arms trade is the least transparent of all weapons trades. Countries must think about whether policies are required 
                for the complete elimination of small arms or whether there are ways of preventing them from getting into the wrong hands.

              <h2>Topic 2: Resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict</h2>
              <p>
                It's been 6 months since the war in Ukraine and it has had devastating effects on Ukraine and the rest of the world. Due to the war, millions of civilians 
                aren't able to come back home and are forced to live without access to clean water, food, and healthcare. There have been more than 13,000 casualties since 
                February 24th and over 5,500 killed and there has been catastrophic damage to civilian infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, buildings, etc. Continued 
                bombings and fighting in Ukraine have forced over 6 million people internally displaced. Women and children have been the most affected, the two groups that 
                are always at risk of exploitation during a crisis and it has further deepened the socioeconomic inequality between men and women due to the loss of livelihood.
                Ukraine was the main exporter of grains and other national resources to many countries like East Africa. Currently, there has been limited to no dialogue 
                between Russia and Ukraine. Member countries of the security council must decide how to bring stability and peace to the region and how to revive the country's 
                social and economic development.

                  <p>
                    Meet Nathan Benedict Crasta, the chairperson of the United Nations Security Council for NMMUN ’22!
                    Nathan is a levelheaded and an inquisitive individual. Apart from being a fervent debater, he’s also a two-time scholar champion in the World Scholar’s Cup and YISMUN’s best speaker!
                    To all delegates, he advices, “Interact with peers and your chairs, and don't forget to laugh at the organizing committee's jokes, or the security will clip you. Do your research, it'll pay off tremendously.” Nathan looks forward to chairing UNSC, as he says, “It is a thrilling council that teaches delegates to understand the workings of a nation.” He aims at making the council a space for delegates to hold candid arguments on their delegations’ purposes.
